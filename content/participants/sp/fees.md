## Non-recurring costs

A once-off take-on charge of ***R 2750*** (excl VAT) will be levied for each new production entity registered under the [SAML2 technology profile]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/_index.md" >}}) to cover the [administrative overheads]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/sp-requirements/_index.md" >}}) of processing a new service provider registration.

Where service providers ask SAFIRE to assist with integration, and where SAFIRE [is able to provide such assistance,]({{< ref "/participants/support/_index.md" >}}) we reserve the right to recover any additional costs we incur at our prevailing consulting rates. This would be negotiated in advance on a per-case basis.

## Recurring costs

SAFIRE does not charge service providers a participation fee, and there are no recurring costs for participating in SAFIRE as a service provider.

## Discounts and exemptions

- Institutions that subscribe to a basket of NREN services from TENET receive up-to a 100% discount on federation participation fees so long as they continue to receive that basket and their total monthly spend with TENET exceeds the required threshold.
- [TENET]({{< ref "safire/governance.md" >}}) may, at its sole discretion, elect to discount or exempt any organisation from paying some or all of the federation participation fees. Such discretion may be applied on recommendation from a [Member]({{< ref "/participants/idp/list.md" >}}) or the operations staff.
