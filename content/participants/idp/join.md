# Join SAFIRE as a Participant

To become an identity provider, you first need to join SAFIRE as a Participant. You do this by completing the [Participation Agreement]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/_index.md" >}}), which outlines the roles and responsibilities of the various role players and is the overarching policy framework for the federation.

The Participation Agreement only needs to be completed once per juristic person, so if you've previously signed the current version of this agreement, you do not need to do so again.

Please sign and scan (or electronically sign) a copy of the Participation Agreement and email it to {{< email "safire@tenet.ac.za" >}}. TENET is happy to accept [scanned documents and/or electronic signatures](https://www.michalsons.com/blog/spring-forest-trading-v-wilberry/14861), and will normally return an electronically signed copy to you.

Should your processes require original manuscript (handwritten) signatures, please courier or post two copies of the signed agreement to [TENET's offices]({{< ref "/safire/contact/_index.md" >}}) (one will ultimately be returned to you by post countersigned by TENET). In addition, to counteract the inevitable postal delays, please send a scanned copy as above.

# Register as an Identity Provider

Once you've been accepted as a Participant, and provided you are eligible, you may register as an identity provider. This generally involves reviewing the requirements for the particular Technology Profile(s) you intend on using, and then completing an appropriate registration request form.

You should be aware that registering as an identity provider means that you will become liable for fees, so please make sure you've understood the [fee structure]({{< ref "/participants/idp/fees.md" >}}).

## SAML2 Technology Profile

To be eligible to become an identity provider in the SAML2 Technology Profile, you need to be a higher educational institution recognised under the Higher Education Act (101 of 1997, as amended) or a public statutory research council. Other requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis by SAFIRE's steering committee.
