This page contains links to more information and technical resources. It will be expanded as time passes, and stuff here may change significantly. The idea is to provide a starting point for people looking to implement an identity or service provider connected to SAFIRE.

> Apart from the [SAFIRE-specific stuff]({{< ref "#safire-specific-stuff" >}}) at the bottom, we make no guarentees of accuracy, relevance, or continued availability of the resources listed here.
