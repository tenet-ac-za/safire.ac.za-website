attributeFormat: |2
  Single valued, containing a well formed DNS domain name that belongs to the home organisation.

  _schacHomeOrganization_ is generated by the Federation Operator unless a properly scoped value is supplied.

  If supplied, the _schacHomeOrganization_ must exactly match one of the `<shibmd:Scope>` elements in the [identity provider's metadata](/technical/saml2/idp-requirements/). Note that scopes are **case sensitive**.
attributeNotes: |2
  For greatest international interoperability, consider using [eduPersonScopedAffiliation](/technical/attributes/edupersonscopedaffiliation) to determine the home organisation.
