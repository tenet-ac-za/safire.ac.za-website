  Multi-valued, scoped, controlled vocabulary per [_eduPersonAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation/). The intention of _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ is to allow more granular affiliation information to be provided --- [_eduPersonAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation/) describes the principal's relationship to an entire institution; _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ can describe a relationship to a particular faculty, department, or division.

  _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ will be generated by SAFIRE from [_eduPersonAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation/) and [_schacHomeOrganization_](/technical/attributes/schachomeorganization/) if not supplied by the identity provider.

  If supplied, the scope portion must match one of the `<shibmd:Scope>` elements in the [identity provider's metadata](/technical/saml2/idp-requirements/) or be a valid (pseudo-)subdomain within the bailiwick of one of those elements.
