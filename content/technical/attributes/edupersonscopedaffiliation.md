  Multi-valued, scoped, controlled vocabulary per [_eduPersonAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation/). The intention of _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ is to allow more granular affiliation information to be provided --- [_eduPersonAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation/) describes the principal's relationship to an entire institution; _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ can describe a relationship to a particular faculty, school, or division.

  _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ will be generated by SAFIRE from [_eduPersonAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation/) and [_schacHomeOrganization_](/technical/attributes/schachomeorganization/) if not supplied by the identity provider.

  If supplied, the scope portion must match one of the `<shibmd:Scope>` elements in the [identity provider's metadata](/technical/saml2/idp-requirements/). Multiple `<shibmd:Scope>` elements may be required if sub-institutional scopes are used.

  ___Note:___ _eduPersonScopedAffiliation_ is [fairly widely shared](/safire/policy/arp/) and not generally considered [personally identifying information](http://www.justice.gov.za/inforeg/). For this reason care must be taken to ensure that the affiliation information asserted via this attribute is not too granular: faculty level information is appropriate but departmental level has the potential to inadvertently leak personal information.
