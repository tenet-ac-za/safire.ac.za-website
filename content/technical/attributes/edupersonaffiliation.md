    * employee
    * staff
    * alum

  _The above example would represent a person who is currently an administrative staff member and who is also an alumnus of the institution._
attributeFormat: |2
  Multi-valued with a controlled vocabulary --- only the following affiliations are accepted:

    * alum
    * affiliate
    * employee _(implies member)_
    * faculty _(implies employee, member)_
    * library-walk-in
    * member
    * staff _(implies employee, member)_
    * student _(implies member)_
attributeNotes: |2
  The semantics of various affiliations is described in bold in the [ePSA usage comparison](https://refeds.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ePSAcomparison_0_13.pdf).

  For South African universities, these should be interpreted so as to align with the Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) data elements. Thus the _eduPersonAffiliation_ definitions of "student", "faculty" &amp; "staff" should be aligned with the HEMIS definitions for "enrolled student" (both undergraduate and postgraduate) and the "instruction/research professional (academic)", and "executive/administrative/managerial professional + specialised/support professional + technical + non-professional administration (senior management, administrative & support staff)" personnel categories respectively. Staff in the "trade/craft + service" HEMIS personnel categories would typically only be an _eduPersonAffilliation_ "employee" (however depending on institutional policy they may additionally classify as "staff".

  Note that where an affiliation value above says "implies&hellip;" the implied values **must** also be included in the returned set. The most significant/primary one from the set can then be returned separately as [_eduPersonPrimaryAffiliation_](/technical/attributes/edupersonprimaryaffiliation/).

  The non-normative diagram below shows how the implied values result in nesting such that the outermost value implicitly includes all of the inner ones.
