In addition to the [Participation Agreement]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/_index.md" >}}), participants who wish to participate in the SAML2 Technology Profile need to complete the appropriate registration request form. There is a separate form for identity- and service-providers, and one form needs to be completed per metadata entity.

  * [SAFIRE SAML2 IdP Registration Request Form (v20220217)](./SAFIRE-SAML2-IdP-Registration-20220217.pdf)
  * [SAFIRE SAML2 SP Registration Request Form (v20220217)](./SAFIRE-SAML2-SP-Registration-20220217.pdf)

These forms supplement and are used to validate the information provided in metadata.

Note that if you need to attest [Sirtfi](https://refeds.org/sirtfi) compliance, in addition to a registration request you also need to [supply a statement of your Sirtfi compliance]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/sirtfi/_index.md" >}}).

Please ensure you always have the most up-to-date versions of these forms from this page.
