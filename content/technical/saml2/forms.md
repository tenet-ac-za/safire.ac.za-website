In addition to the [Participation Agreement](/safire/policy/participation/), participants who wish to participate in the SAML2 Technology Profile need to complete the appropriate registration request form. There is a separate form for identity- and service-providers, and one form needs to be completed per metadata entity.

  * [SAFIRE SAML2 IdP Registration Request Form (v20170623)](/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SAFIRE-SAML2-IdP-Registration-20170623.pdf)
  * [SAFIRE SAML2 SP Registration Request Form (v20170620)](/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SAFIRE-SAML2-SP-Registration-20170620.pdf)

These forms supplement and are used to validate the information provided in metadata.

Please ensure you always have the most up-to-date versions of these forms from this page.
