> Changes to the Participation Agreement are approved by TENET's Board of Directors. Version [v20161018]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/v20161018.md" >}}) reached rough consensus within the community and was subsequently ratified on 26 October 2016. This revision contains minor edits to acknowledge the [publication of a fee structure on 1 May 2019]({{< ref "/safire/news/20190110-safire-price-structure-may-2019.md" >}}), and to record the Participation Agreement's subordinance to the 2020 revision of TENET's REN Master Service Agreement.

There are some [notes on interpretation]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/practice-note.md" >}}) available to help decision makers.
