_Changes to the Participation Agreement are approved by TENET's Board of Directors. This version reached rough consensus within the community and was subsequently ratified on 26 October 2016. As a revision of [v20160916]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/v20160916.md" >}}),Â it contains minor typographical edits and the insertion of one new clause at 6.5._

There are some [notes on interpretation]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/practice-note.md" >}}) available to help decision makers.
