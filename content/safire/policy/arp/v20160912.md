---

Management of attribute release to Service Providers has been delegated to the Federation Operator in terms of the [Participation Agreement](/safire/policy/participation/). Through a community consensus process, the following attribute release profiles have been approved:

# Default

The release profile used when no other attribute release policy is defined:

  * [eduPersonTargetedID]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersontargetedid.md" >}})

  * [schacHomeOrganizationType]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/schachomeorganizationtype.md" >}})

# Research & Scholarship

The release profile used when a service provider is tagged with the research and scholarship entity category ([https://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship](https://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship)), but no service-specific attribute release policy is specified:

  * [displayName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/displayname.md" >}})

  * [eduPersonPrincipalName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonprincipalname.md" >}})

  * [eduPersonScopedAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonscopedaffiliation.md" >}})

  * [eduPersonTargetedID]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersontargetedid.md" >}})

  * [givenName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/givenname.md" >}})

  * [mail]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/mail.md" >}})

  * [schacHomeOrganizationType]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/schachomeorganizationtype.md" >}})

  * [sn]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/sn.md" >}})

# Negotiated

Individual service providers can negotiate an attribute release policy on a per-entity basis, based on the principle of minimality --- requested attributes must be adequate, relevant, and not excessive.

A list of all supported attributes [is available](/technical/attributes/).
