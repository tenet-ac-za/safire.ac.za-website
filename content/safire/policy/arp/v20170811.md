_Changes to the Attribute Release Policy are approved by the SAFIRE Steering Committee. This version reached rough consensus on 11 August 2017 and still needs to be ratified. As a revision to the previous version, it allows affiliation attributes to be released in the default ARP._

Management of attribute release to Service Providers has been delegated to the Federation Operator in terms of the [Participation Agreement]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/_index.md" >}}).

# Attribute Release Profiles

Through a community consensus process, the following attribute release profiles have been approved:

### Default

The Default release profile used when no other attribute release policy is defined:

  * [eduPersonAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation.md" >}})
  * [eduPersonScopedAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonscopedaffiliation.md" >}})
  * [eduPersonTargetedID]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersontargetedid.md" >}})
  * [schacHomeOrganizationType]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/schachomeorganizationtype.md" >}})

### Research & Scholarship

The Research & Scholarship release profile used when a service provider is tagged with the research and scholarship entity category ([https://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship](https://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship)), but no service-specific attribute release policy is specified:

  * [displayName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/displayname.md" >}})
  * [eduPersonAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation.md" >}})
  * [eduPersonPrincipalName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonprincipalname.md" >}})
  * [eduPersonScopedAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonscopedaffiliation.md" >}})
  * [eduPersonTargetedID]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersontargetedid.md" >}})
  * [givenName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/givenname.md" >}})
  * [mail]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/mail.md" >}})
  * [schacHomeOrganizationType]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/schachomeorganizationtype.md" >}})
  * [sn]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/sn.md" >}})

### Negotiated

Individual service providers can negotiate a customised attribute release policy on a per-entity basis, based on the principle of minimality --- requested attributes must be adequate, relevant, and not excessive.

A list of all supported attributes [is available]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/_index.md" >}}).

# Inter-federation

The release profiles above apply irrespective of whether we learn about a service provider via inter-federation (e.g. eduGAIN) or whether they are [direct participants]({{< ref "/participants/sp/_index.md" >}}). This means that, for example, service providers tagged as meeting the Research & Scholarship requirements by another federation will automatically have our Research & Scholarship release profile applied.

However, in practice, how we apply the Negotiated release profile differs depending on whether we've learnt about a service provider via inter-federation or whether they're a direct participant.

For service providers learnt via inter-federation we are generally willing to negotiate attribute release of any attributes listed in the Research & Scholarship profile provided that at least one [participating identity provider]({{< ref "/participants/idp/list.md" >}}) has expressed interest in using the service. Service providers who require more attributes than the R&S profile supports _may_ be requested to [join]({{< ref "/participants/sp/join.md" >}}) the Federation as a direct participant, particularly where those attributes constitute [personal information](https://www.acts.co.za/protection-of-personal-information-/1__definitions).
