Identity federations are built around a trust model that requires complete transparency of policy and process. Thus in this section of the web site, you will find the policies, processes, and practice statements that govern the South African Identity Federation. In general, and as part of a commitment to transparency, historical versions of documents are preserved. Thus each document below has a canonical, current version and one or more historical versions.
