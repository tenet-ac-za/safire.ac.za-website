title: Privacy statement updated
---

SAFIRE's [privacy statement]({{< ref "/safire/policy/privacy/_index.md" >}}) has been updated.<!--more-->

The new version is a complete rewrite of the 2016 version. It aims to use clearer, more accessible language and tries to better explain how we handle your personal information. In addition, information around the handling of consent and cookies has been updated to reflect [the changes that occurred earlier this year]({{< relref "20180622-transfer-notice-cookies.md" >}}).

The [SAFIRE Participants' Forum]({{< ref "/safire/policy/forum/_index.md" >}}) was given an opportunity to provide feedback on the revised statement before it was taken to the [Steering Committee]({{< ref "/safire/governance.md" >}}) for final approval.
