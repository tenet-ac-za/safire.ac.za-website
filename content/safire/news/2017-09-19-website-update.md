SAFIRE's website was originally created using Wordpress, something that was inherited when custodianship of the federation passed [to TENET]({{< ref "/safire/news/safire-project-director-appointed.md" >}}). For various reasons we have decided to abandon Wordpress in favour of a modern static site generator, and have chosen to adopt [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

One substantial benefit of this approach is increased transparency, particularly around changes to [policies](/safire/policies/). The Hugo source is
stored in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/safire-ac-za/safire-ac-za.github.io), thus allowing Participants to peruse the commit history of any document.

During transfer from Wordpress, every effort was made to preserve existing URLs and the [current theme](https://github.com/safire-ac-za/safire-ac-za.github.io/tree/master/themes). It is expected that this change should be largely transparent. However, please [let us know]({{< ref "/safire/contact/_index.md" >}}) if anything is missing. The old Wordpress site has been temporarily retained at <https://old.safire.ac.za/>, where it'll remain accessible for a couple of weeks.
