As a hub-and-spoke identity federation, SAFIRE directly [handles the personal information of users]({{< ref "/safire/policy/privacy/_index.md" >}}). Recognising that security is a key concern, an external vulnerability assessment of SAFIRE's publicly-visible infrastructure was recently undertaken by the [SANReN Computer Security Incident Response Team](https://csirt.sanren.ac.za/) (CSIRT). The purpose of this assessment was to ensure that SAFIRE's web servers complied with best practices and to try and preemptively mitigate any security problems.

The resulting report raised a number of relatively minor concerns. As far as is practical, these have all been addressed --- either by actively identifying the finding as a false positive (expected behaviour) or by altering configurations to remediate the problem. Some of the CSIRT findings resulted in [patches being submitted](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/pull/533) back to the original software projects, allowing others to benefit from our discoveries.

SAFIRE's web infrastructure also rates reasonably well on a number of publicly available metrics, such as those from [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html?host=iziko.safire.ac.za).

The SANReN CSIRT offers [vulnerability assessments as a service](https://csirt.sanren.ac.za/services_vulnscan.html) to the South African NREN beneficiary community, which will include most [identity providers within SAFIRE]({{< ref "/participants/idp/_index.md" >}}).
