The [South African Theological Seminary](https://www.sats.edu.za) has signed the Participation Agreement, completed their [SAML technical integration]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/_index.md" >}}) and are the first privately owned institution in South Africa to join SAFIRE. We would like to welcome SATS on board as a fully functioning identity provider.
