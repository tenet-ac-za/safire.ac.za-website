title: "SAFIRE Participants Forum Meeting: 21 September"
---

On Thursday 21 September, we'll be convening a meeting of the SAFIRE Participants Forum. The preliminary agenda for this meeting contains a single item: _the future governance of the South African Identity Federation_.

 * Venue: ZA·REN Week '23 Conference, Protea Hotel Breakwater Lodge, Cape Town
 * Date: 21 September 2023
 * Time: 13:00-15:00<!--more-->

This will be an in-person meeting, collocated with the [ZA·REN Week '23 conference](https://zaren23.nren.ac.za/) and immediately following the SLA Reference Group Meeting. Given the import of the agenda, we would encourage participants — and particularly those representing SAFIRE identity providers — to attend if they can. We've deliberately scheduled it to ensure those who're also attending the conference and/or SLA Reference Group Meeting will still be able to make evening flights.

Attendance at the Participants Forum is open to designated representatives of any SAFIRE participant. [Registration is required](https://events.tenet.ac.za/event/47/) to ensure appropriate catering, and to determine eligibility.

We'd also encourage you to attend the ZA·REN Week '23 Conference itself, and to consider presenting in the T&I session. Please see [https://zaren23.nren.ac.za/](https://zaren23.nren.ac.za/) for details of the conference and the [call for presentations](https://events.tenet.ac.za/event/33/attachments/14/30/ZA%E2%80%A2NREN%20'23_Call%20for%20presentations.pdf).
