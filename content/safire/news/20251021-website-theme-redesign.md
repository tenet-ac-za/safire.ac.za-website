title: SAFIRE website redesign
---

We're pleased to announce that the SAFIRE website has received a fresh new look and feel, designed to improve your browsing experience and make it easier to find the information you need.<!--more-->

This refresh was long overdue. The website has quite a history: it began as a WordPress site inherited from before SAFIRE was formally established, [moved to Hugo in 2017]({{< ref "2017-09-19-website-update.md" >}}), but retained the twentyfourteen WordPress theme as a placeholder. Despite [early intents to redesign the page]({{< ref "website-update-sept16.md" >}}) once the federation's brand identity was established, the page's look and feel has remained largely unchanged since the beginning. The new design includes a number of visual improvements and accessibility enhancements, while maintaining all the familiar content and navigation you're used to. We've also improved the underlying technical architecture to ensure the site continues to serve you well into the future.

As with any website update, there's always a possibility that something might not work quite as expected. If you notice any content that appears broken, missing, or difficult to access, please don't hesitate to let us know.

You can report any issues or provide feedback by contacting us using the details on our [contact page]({{< ref "/safire/contact/_index.md" >}}). We appreciate your help in making the SAFIRE website the best it can be.

Thank you for your continued participation in the Federation, and we hope you enjoy the improved website experience.
