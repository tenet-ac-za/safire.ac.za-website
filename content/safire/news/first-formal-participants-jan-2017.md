SAFIRE has its first few formal signatories to the new [Participation Agreement](/safire/policy/participation/), ushering in the next phase of the South African Identity Federation. [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/) became the first university (and identity provider) to sign, and the [Square Kilometer Array South Africa](http://www.ska.ac.za/) became the first major South African service provider. In addition, [Kivuto Inc](http://kivuto.com/) became the first non-South African organisation to join as a service provider. We welcome all three to SAFIRE, and the start of what we hope is a long and fruitful relationship.

We're working with these and other potential participants to complete the technical requirements for the [transition to a hub-and-spoke architecture]({{< ref "/safire/news/safire-transition-plan.md" >}}). We're also eagerly awaiting the release of our [HSMs]({{< ref "/safire/news/hsm-for-metadata-signing-20161104.md" >}}) from customs, which will allow us to complete the generation of [metadata signing keys]({{< ref "/technical/metadata.md" >}}). Hopefully all of this will be completed within the next few weeks.
