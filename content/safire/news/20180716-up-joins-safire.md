The [University of Pretoria](http://www.up.ac.za/) has signed the Participation Agreement and joined SAFIRE. They are in the process of completing their [SAML technical integration]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/_index.md" >}}), and we hope to welcome them on board as a fully functioning identity provider in the near future.
