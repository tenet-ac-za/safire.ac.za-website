title: T&I Info Sharing Sessions
---

TENET's trust & identity team run regular information sharing sessions covering SAFIRE and [other services](https://www.tenet.ac.za/services). A full schedule of forthcoming events is available at [events.tenet.ac.za](https://events.tenet.ac.za/).<!--more-->

The monthly T&I info sharing sessions are aimed at those responsible for administering or maintaining the respective services within their institution. We use the sessions as an informal way for us to provide feedback and answer questions from the community. There's no set agenda, but we sometimes suggest topics we feel might be useful.

The SAFIRE-specific sessions occur every three months.
