The [University of the Witwatersrand](http://www.wits.ac.za/) has signed the Participation Agreement and joined SAFIRE. They have not yet completed the [SAML technical integration]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/_index.md" >}}), but we hope to welcome them on board as a fully functioning identity provider in the near future.
