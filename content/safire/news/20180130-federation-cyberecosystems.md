The benefits identity federations, and specifically eduGAIN, bring to scientific cyberecosystems was the subject of a [recent article in HPCwire](https://www.hpcwire.com/2018/01/11/uriscsc17-and-the-longestlastmile/).<!--more-->

The HPCwire article summarises content from the recent [URISC@SC17](http://www.stem-trek.org/news-events/urisc/) workshop in Denver, Colorado. It highlights a number of success stories in fields such a high energy physics, astronomy, and computational biology. In particular, mention is made of a number of projects that South Africa is keenly involed in, not least of which being the [Square Kilometre Array](http://www.ska.ac.za/). It goes on to talk about how identity federation --- and in particular, eduGAIN --- plays a key role in simplifying these collaboration.

One of the earliest use cases for eduGAIN came from South African institutions collaborating with the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/). Likewise, the use of [Globus](http://www.globus.org/) has driven the [adoption]({{< ref "uct-complies-with-sirtfi.md" >}}) of [Security Incident Response Trust Framework for Federated Identity (Sirtfi)](http://refeds.org/sirtfi).

We're proud of the small role SAFIRE, and our membership of eduGAIN, has played in this, and hope to continue serving our beneficiary community.
