The following details contact information for emergency security incident response involving the South African Identity Federation or one of its participants. Separate contact details are available for [participants looking for support]({{< ref "/participants/support.md" >}}) and for [general use]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}).

# Federation operations staff

During South African working hours (typically [Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM UTC+2](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/personal.html?cities=56,1440,136,16,26,125,170,47,196,248,22,44,33,64,137,179,220&wch=3)), you can reach federation operations staff using the following contact details:

Email
: {{< email "safire-ops@lists.tenet.ac.za" >}}

Telephone
: [+27.21.763.7156](tel:+27.21.763.7156)

All federation operations staff understand and will honour the [traffic light protocol](https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp), and follow the [Sirtfi norms](https://refeds.org/sirtfi). In addition, these staff routinely make use of S/MIME for email communication and can communicate using PGP if required.

# CSIRT

The South African NREN operates a sector CSIRT consisting of two parts: a proactive and a reactive component. These act as a unified team, but have different staffing and contact information.

* [RFC2350 information](https://csirt.sanren.ac.za/rfc2350.html)
* [Trusted Introducer listing](https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams/sa-nren-csirt.html)
* [FIRST team information](https://www.first.org/members/teams/sa_nren_csirt)

Note that for operational reasons, we cannot guarentee that all recipients of email to the general CSIRT contact email addresses will necessarily honour the traffic light protocol. In addition, use of cryptography may be variable. Contacts obtained via Trusted Introducer or FIRST will, however.

# After hours

During reasonable waking hours, email sent to the [federation operations staff]({{< relref "#federation-operations-staff" >}}) will likely be read within a few hours.

Outside these times or when an incident is urgent or time critical, TENET operates a 24&times;7&times;365 first-level [service desk](https://www.tenet.ac.za/support), reachable after hours at:

Telephone
: **[+27.21.763.7147](tel:+27.21.763.7147)**

The TENET service desk does not routinely handle security incidents and may not honour the traffic light protocol. However they have an on-call list available and can reach an appropriate security contact in an emergency.
