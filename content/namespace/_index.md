SAFIRE is the custodian of several uniform resource identifier namespaces. These are either delegated to it by an upstream resource registry or established by SAFIRE directly within the context of the domain name system. These namespaces are used to facilitate various federation and ancillary operations, and portions of them may be subdelegated to various [SAFIRE participants]({{< ref "/participants/_index.md" >}}) to meet specific operational requirements.
