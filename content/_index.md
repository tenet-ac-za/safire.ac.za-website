Welcome to the South African Identity Federation (SAFIRE) --- the national academic identity federation for the South African research and higher education community.

SAFIRE enables seamless, secure collaboration across South Africa's academic landscape by allowing students, staff, and researchers to use their home institution credentials to access resources at universities and research organizations worldwide. Whether you're a higher education institution looking to simplify access management and reduce support costs, a research council seeking to enhance collaboration opportunities, or a service provider wanting to reach the South African academic community with verified user credentials, SAFIRE provides the trusted infrastructure to make it happen.
