        Metadata for South African institutions exists, and a WAYFless URL reaches the right identity provider. At least one university has reported that this works correctly. However, there's no obvious end-user method of reaching an institutional login page.

        There is, however, a user guide available at the documentation link on how to use your institutional credentials to sign in via SeamlessAccess.

        While SAFIRE IdP's are found at [OpenAthens | Institutional](https://ovidsp.ovid.com/), they are not necessarily authorised to access the service. No documentation has been found on what libraries need to do to enable federated (Shibboleth/institutional) access, but the most likely course of action would be to contact Ovid SP support to request that access be enabled for your institution.

        This is marked working but untested because we've had no confirmation of a SAFIRE participant using it successfully. However, because the service appears to have adopted SeamlessAccess it's highly likely that it works in an interoperable way.
