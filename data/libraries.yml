      Notes: |
        Libraries need to set an appropriate value for eduPersonScopedAfilliation within the EBSCOadmin portal. However, the discovery service is confusing for end users: all of SAFIRE appears under "UK Higher Education", and institution names are not always in English (e.g. UCT is listed as "IYunivesithi yaseKapa"). EBSCO has been contacted to try and resolve this.
